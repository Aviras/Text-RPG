Text RPG is a low fantasy RPG in a new universe with a mix of graphical and text input and output. It has gone through many iterations: from a simple DOS window where dungeons were just a follow-up of enemies, no real NPC communication, let alone more complicated systems such as weather and the hope system, up to the version you see now. At the moment of writing, this evolution has been happening over the past 2 years. 

This started as a project outside of university that I finally wanted to finish. It wasn't the first game I tried my hands on, but it would be the first one I actually pushed through and finished. I learned a lot about game design, even though it might not shine through as much as I would've wanted in this game. It was a great experience both from a programming perspective as well as for organizing, and thinking ahead instead of diving head first.
