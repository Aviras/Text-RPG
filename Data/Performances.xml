    <name>I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud</name>
    <text> I wandered lonely as a cloud
                That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
                When all at once I saw a crowd,
                A host, of golden daffodils;
                Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
                Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

                Continuous as the stars that shine
                And twinkle on the milky way,
                They stretched in never-ending line
                Along the margin of a bay:
                Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
                Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

                The waves beside them danced, but they
                Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;
                A poet could not be but gay,
                In such a jocund company!
                I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
                What wealth the show to me had brought:

                For oft, when on my couch I lie
                In vacant or in pensive mood,
                They flash upon that inward eye
                Which is the bliss of solitude;
                And then my heart with pleasure fills,
                And dances with the daffodils.

    <name>All the World's a Stage</name>
    <text>All the world's a stage,
              And all the men and women merely players;
              They have their exits and their entrances,
              And one man in his time plays many parts,
              His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
              Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
              Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
              And shining morning face, creeping like snail
              Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
              Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
              Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
              Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
              Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
              Seeking the bubble reputation
              Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
              In fair round belly with good capon lined,
              With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
              Full of wise saws and modern instances;
              And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
              Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
              With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
              His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
              For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
              Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
              And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
              That ends this strange eventful history,
              Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
              Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
