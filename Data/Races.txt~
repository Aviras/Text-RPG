info Edorian
Living in a once great trades city, Edorians are known for their cunning
and barter capabilities. Due to a fortunate location, natural resources
were plenty. For over a century Edoras flourished, the population knowing
prosperity and rapid growth. The burg took the heaviest impact when
the Great Invasion of the second era hit home, however.

Having to start over from ruins, ash and dashed hopes, it took will and
perseverance to rebuild on still fresh memories. Since then, the people
have embraced faith, putting mental practice above physical wealth.

info Alberian
The Alberians haven't always had their homeland in these regions.
After nearly being wiped off the face of the world by tremendous
thunderstorms, earthquakes and the rise of the water, they set out
to new lands to inhabit.

Their journey was long and tiresome. Predators of all kinds lurk in the shadows.
An Alberian has to be skilled with the sword in order to survive.

They are the most skilled craftsmen you will meet when moving through these lands.
