      <info>Living in a once great trades city, Dorsi are known for their cunning
                and barter capabilities. Due to a fortunate location, natural resources
                were plenty. For over a century Dolorem flourished, the population knowing
                prosperity and rapid growth. The burg took the heaviest impact when
                the Great Invasion of the second era hit home, however.

        The Alberians haven't always had their homeland in these regions.
        After nearly being wiped off the face of the world by tremendous
        thunderstorms, earthquakes and the rise of the water, they set out
        to new lands to inhabit.

        Their journey was long and tiresome. Predators of all kinds lurk in the shadows.
        An Alberian has to be skilled with the sword in order to survive.

        They are the most skilled craftsmen you will meet when moving through these lands.
