            <text_all>We currently have a problem with communication with neigbouring villages to help each other get the crops from the fields.
            Since this is a critical time of year, we can't go off ourselves and leave our crops alone.
            This is where you come in. I need you to get the message to all neighbouring villages that we will start five days from. You'd be a big help.</text_all>
